    "After training your model on the training data and validating it using a separate validation set, the next crucial step is to test its final prediction performance using a test dataset—one that the model has never encountered before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this so important? The test set serves as the ultimate benchmark for your model’s ability to generalize. If you've fine-tuned your model and adjusted hyperparameters based on the validation data, using the test data for any adjustments can lead to overfitting, meaning your model will perform well only on the test set, not on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that testing should be the final step. Once you run your model on the test data, avoid making further changes. Any adjustments after testing would compromise the integrity of the test set, which is meant to be the unbiased evaluation of how well your model will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, once you test, you're done refining. This is the point at which you can confidently assess the model’s true predictive power."
