    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "Imagine you’re working with data from an Audiobook App that tracks customer purchases and engagement. Every customer in the system has made at least one purchase, so we already know they’ve interacted with the app. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will make another purchase in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this matter? If we can accurately identify which customers are likely to return, we can focus our marketing efforts and advertising budgets on those who are most likely to convert again. This targeted approach helps save resources and maximize growth potential. In addition, the model can uncover the key factors that influence a customer’s likelihood to return, providing valuable insights into customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we’re working with contains several variables such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer ID (an identifier for each customer),\n",
    "Book Length (overall and average) (how much time the customer has spent listening to books),\n",
    "Price Paid (overall and average) (how much the customer has spent),\n",
    "Review (whether the customer left a review),\n",
    "Review Rating (if a review was left, how it was rated),\n",
    "Total Minutes Listened,\n",
    "Completion (how much of the audiobook they listened to),\n",
    "Support Requests (how often they’ve contacted support),\n",
    "Time Since Last Purchase (how many days since their last purchase).\n",
    "The task is to use the data from the last 2 years of customer activity and predict whether they will make another purchase in the next 6 months. This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to classify customers into two categories: those who will buy again (1) and those who won’t (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "By building this model, we can gain insights into customer behavior, make smarter marketing decisions, and improve customer retention strategies."

    "## Preprocess the data. Balance the dataset. Create 3 datasets: training, validation, and test. Save the newly created sets in a tensor friendly format (e.g. *.npz)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with real life data, we will need to preprocess it a bit. This is the relevant code, which is not that hard, but is crucial to creating a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know how to do that, go through the code with comments. In any case, this should do the trick for most datasets organized in the way: many inputs, and then 1 cell containing the targets (supersized learning datasets). Keep in mind that a specific problem may require additional preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have removed the header row, which contains the names of the categories. We simply want the data."
